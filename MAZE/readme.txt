\f0\fs24 \cf0 Description:\
\
This is a video Game called Maze(in funky text). The game consists of a room saved as a 2D list in a txt file being represented in 3D from a first person perspective. The goal of the game is to pick up all the balls and get them to the goal without being overpowered by enemies.\
\
How to Run:\
Run main.py, this displays the main menu and gives access to all the other files that the user would need to see.\
\
Libraries:\
No external libraries, all necessary external files are included(really only debounder.py, which is not of my own creation)\
\
Shortcut commands not available. \
\
I focused much on the user experience, the player shouldn\'92t be able to do something that developer related and so long as main.py is ran a user should be able to see all that\'92s intended to be seen.}
